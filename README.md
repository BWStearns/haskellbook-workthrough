#Haskell Book Workthrough

This project is just where I am keeping my work while going through the **[Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/)** book.

I'm using the [Haskell for Mac](http://haskellformac.com/) environment and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to just get to learning the language instead of spending a fair amount of time fiddling with the myriad (albeit constantly improving) Haskell build and environment tools.
