#Haskell Book Workthrough

This project is just where I am keeping my work while going through the **[Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/)** book.

Most of the work is in the HaskellBook.hsproj directory. The haskell-book directory is from when I had just started working through the project and before I had discovered Haskell for Mac.

If you are not already familiar with Stack or Hackage or nix etc. using the [Haskell for Mac](http://haskellformac.com/) environment is highly recommend (by me). There are lots of great build and env management tools in the Haskell community and a lot of them have some really awesoem ideas that I hope get escape velocity and end up in the broader software ecosystem, but if you just want to get right to learning about types and trying to figure out what a ~~burrito~~ monad is then Haskell for Mac is probably the easiest way to go about doing that.
